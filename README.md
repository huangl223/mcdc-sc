This repository contains the programs used in the experiment for comparing the bug detection capability of three test generation strategies: seeding contradiction for branch coverage (Branch-SC), seeding contradiction for MCDC (MCDC-SC), adaptive random testing (AutoTest).
Both Branch-SC and MCDC-SC strategies are implemented in AutoProof. The AutoProof and AutoTest tool are both integrated in the EiffelStudio IDE, which is available at: https://github.com/huangl223/ES-AP-Installation.
